The **Sleep Apnea Non-Profit Project** was founded with a mission to assist individuals suffering from sleep apnea by developing affordable and accessible detection technology. The project began in response to a personal family need and quickly expanded to help others in the community. As part of this initiative, I designed and built a comprehensive system aimed at detecting sleep apnea symptoms early, allowing users to seek medical advice and treatment before the condition worsens. This system uses a blood oxygen sensor to monitor key indicators during sleep, and the data is visualized through a user-friendly web application.

# Key Contributions:

**Developed a Sleep Apnea Detection System**: I created a detection system integrating a **blood oxygen sensor** (SpO2) with a real-time monitoring platform. This system continuously measures oxygen saturation levels in users' blood during sleep, identifying any anomalies such as drops in oxygen levels, which are characteristic of sleep apnea.
  
**Built a Web Application for Data Monitoring**: The collected data is transmitted to a custom-built **web application**, where users can visualize their sleep patterns, oxygen levels, and receive alerts if abnormal patterns are detected. The web app was designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that elderly users could navigate it easily. It is also mobile-compatible for convenient access on smartphones and tablets.

**Community Impact**: The system has been deployed to **20+ individuals**, including family, friends, and members of the local community. This includes a collaboration with **Cedar Creek of Bloomington Assisted Living**, where the system has been installed to help caregivers monitor the sleep health of seniors in their care. The devices have helped monitor the condition of vulnerable populations, and we’ve received positive feedback from users and caregivers alike.

**Ongoing Development**: We are currently in the **research and development phase** for the next generation of the detection system. This new iteration aims to improve the accuracy of the sensor and enhance the user interface of the web app based on feedback from users and caregivers. Additionally, we are working on incorporating machine learning techniques to better predict and classify sleep apnea events.

**Fundraising and Expansion**: As the project grows, we are exploring different ways to **raise funds** to scale up production and distribute the system to a wider audience. This includes planning **fundraising events**, applying for grants, and seeking partnerships with local businesses and healthcare providers. The long-term goal is to make this technology accessible to those who cannot afford more expensive commercial devices, especially in underserved communities.

# Co-founders:

While the project was initiated by me, I am grateful for the contributions of my dedicated team of co-founders. Together, we’ve worked to bring this project to life.
